# DREAMS Velocity Distributions
Code used to produce dark matter velocity distributions from DREAMS CDM simulations. One tutorial showing how to get the velocity distribution using kernel density estimation, and one tutorial for using the velocity distribution with the NeHOD emulator.

KDE_Tutorial shows how to get the velocity distributions and then plotting them. 

Emulator_Tutorial shows how to get emulated velocity distributions using the NeHOD normalizing flows emulator. Based on the emulator from https://github.com/trivnguyen/nehod_torch
